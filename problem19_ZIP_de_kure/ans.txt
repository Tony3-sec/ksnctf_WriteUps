Hint:
- It is known that the encryption system of ZIP is weak against known-plaintext attacks.
- We employ ZIP format not for compression but for encryption.
[flag.zip] flag.html password

## ZIP file is password protected. Hint is known-plaintext attacks.

To perform plaintext attack you need to:
 
•	Find an unencrypted file which also exists in the password-protected archive.
•	Compress it with the same method and the same ZIP archiver as used in the encrypted archive

## If you google the file "Standard-lock-key.jpg", you can find the original file in wikipedia

NOTE:
Compression method is very important. 
When I check flag.zip with unzip -Z option: 

$ unzip -Z flag.zip
Archive:  flag.zip
Zip file size: 256719 bytes, number of entries: 2
-rw-a--     2.0 fat      304 Bl stor 12-Jun-03 18:14 flag.html
-rw-a--     2.0 fat   255964 Bl stor 12-Jun-03 18:10 Standard-lock-key.jpg

The files are "stor" which means they are not compressed. So I have to zip the file "Standard-lock-key.jpg" without compression. I used zip -0 command to achieve this.

$ zip -0 no.zip Standard-lock-key.jpg
  adding: Standard-lock-key.jpg (stored 0%)


Now perform known-plaintext attack. I used pkcrack for the tool. I ran below commands:

pkcrack -C flag.zip -c Standard-lock-key.jpg -p Standard-lock-key.jpg -P no.zip -d decrypted.zip


unzip the decrypted.zip. "flag.html" will be extracted. 
Open "flag.html" and you can get a flag.
